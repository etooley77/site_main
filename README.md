This is an ongoing project!!!

Made with Django.

A forums page is all that is there right now, but here is the checklist for things that I will add : 
1. Forums (DONE!)
2. Comment Section on Posts in Forums (DONE!)
3. A Reply System for Comments Section (IN PROGRESS!)
4. Profiles (ALSO IN PROGRESS!)
6. Messaging
7. Uploading images
8. Looking at images, saving them, downloading them, image albums
9. Maybe some things to purchase later on (It's kind of complicated)
